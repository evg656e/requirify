# requirify

Node-style require for browser-like and QML JavaScript environments.

## Why?

Super fast (in terms of setup) prototyping. No need to build assets, no need to rebuild QML apps. When ready, fallback to Webpack (or whatever tool) builds.

## Install

npm install @evg656e/requirify --save-dev

## Usage

Coming soon...
